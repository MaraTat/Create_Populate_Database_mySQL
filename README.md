# Create_Populate_Database_mySQL

The code included here is my own work from a coursework during my Bioinformatics studies and it complements the functions from repo No_Biopython_No_problem. Other outlays might be suitable but require altering of the create_query inside this program so remove/add what you need for your work

The data to be inserted can be imported as a module at the top or as single files from your computer. Configuration information for the database is external and needs to be imported at the top as well for your own db


As always help yourselves and help others if you can :-) 


If you have any issues don't hesitate to drop me a line, always happy to help!!
